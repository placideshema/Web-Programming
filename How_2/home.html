            <p class="pragraph1">The Street Bridge Foundation is a youth-led non-profit 
                organization based in Kigali, Rwanda. Its mission is to empower 
                vulnerable street children by providing them with essential 
                resources such as education, healthcare, and family support. 
                Founded during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
                organization focuses on reintegrating these children into 
                society through various programs. <br/>

               <br/> The Street Bridge Foundation is a dynamic, youth-driven 
                non-profit based in Kigali, Rwanda, with a mission to 
                transform the lives of street children and their families.
                Established to address the challenges faced by vulnerable 
                children living on the streets, the foundation rescues them 
                from hazardous environments, re-enrolls them in school, and
                works to empower their households with self-sufficiency 
                skills. The organization believes in community-based 
                solutions, fostering leadership and empathy among both 
                children and their parents.

        <p class="img_descrpt">One of its core programs, Project Street+, helps 
            street children build essential skills for the modern world, such as 
            digital literacy and coding. This initiative is designed to give 
            these children a pathway to meaningful careers while boosting their 
            confidence. Another critical program is the My Hub Business Center, 
            which offers entrepreneurial training to parents, teaching them skills 
            like soap making and tailoring. This allows families to gain financial 
            independence, helping reduce the number of children on the streets by 
            strengthening their homes. Additionally, the Here4U Program connects 
            girls and their mothers with sexual and reproductive health education, 
            emphasizing the importance of making reusable sanitary products, which 
            further promotes self-sufficiency and health awareness.
