            <p class="pragraph1">The Street Bridge Foundation is a youth-led non-profit 
                organization based in Kigali, Rwanda. Its mission is to empower 
                vulnerable street children by providing them with essential 
                resources such as education, healthcare, and family support. 
                Founded during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
                organization focuses on reintegrating these children into 
                society through various programs. </p> 

               <p class="pragraph1" > The Street Bridge Foundation is a dynamic, youth-driven 
                non-profit based in Kigali, Rwanda, with a mission to 
                transform the lives of street children and their families.
                Established to address the challenges faced by vulnerable 
                children living on the streets, the foundation rescues them 
                from hazardous environments, re-enrolls them in school, and
                works to empower their households with self-sufficiency 
                skills. The organization believes in community-based 
                solutions, fostering leadership and empathy among both 
                children and their parents.
